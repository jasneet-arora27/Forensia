                1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
                   - Brief overview of key findings
                   - Assessment of credibility indicators
                   - Highlight of critical moments during the interview
                
                2. EMOTIONAL PATTERN ANALYSIS:
                   - Detailed timeline of emotional states throughout the interview
                   - Identification of baseline emotional state
                   - Analysis of emotional shifts and their correlation with specific topics/questions
                   - Detection of incongruent emotional responses that may indicate deception
                
                3. DECEPTION ANALYSIS:
                   - Identification of potential deception cues based on emotional inconsistencies
                   - Analysis of micro-expressions that contradict stated emotions
                   - Assessment of emotional suppression or exaggeration
                   - Evaluation of response patterns when addressing critical questions
                
                4. BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS:
                   - Analysis of hand gestures and their psychological significance
                   - Assessment of self-soothing behaviors, defensive postures, or other stress indicators
                   - Identification of truthfulness indicators vs. potential deception markers
                   - Analysis of behavioral clusters that suggest psychological distress
                
                5. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE:
                   - Assessment of subject's emotional stability throughout the session
                   - Identification of topics that trigger significant emotional responses
                   - Analysis of potential psychological vulnerabilities or defense mechanisms
                
                6. INVESTIGATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
                   - Suggested follow-up questions based on identified inconsistencies
                   - Topics that warrant further exploration
                   - Interview strategy recommendations for future sessions
                   - Areas where additional evidence might be needed
                
                7. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS:
                   - Acknowledge limitations of the analysis
                   - Confidence level in findings
                
                Format the report professionally with clear section headers, timestamps where relevant, and evidence-based conclusions.
