            Gain immediate insight into behavioral patterns and emotional
            responses captured during investigative sessions. The AI analyzes
            facial expressions, voice stress, and micro-behaviors to highlight
            moments of tension, evasion, or inconsistency—helping investigators
            pinpoint areas that may warrant deeper examination. Key indicators
            are surfaced in a clear, time-stamped format to support faster and
            more focused decision-making.

            Use dynamic filters and comparative tools to explore multiple

            or verifying statements against behavioral cues, this overview
            delivers critical intelligence to enhance the accuracy and
            efficiency of your investigation.
